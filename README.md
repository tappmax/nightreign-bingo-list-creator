# Getting started

## Set up your data

1. Open `./src/data.ts`.
2. Look at the format of the data, read the comments.
3. Delete the filler/example squares.
4. Fill out your own squares in the format of the example squares.

## Using the web app

1. Use the form to select the Shifting Earth and Nightfarer types.
2. Click the "Generate Bingo Board/Eligible Squares

The app generates an example bingo board with "Defeat the Nightlord" in the middle.
All squares used are compatible with the selections made in the form.
If you change form options, click the button again to make sure your changes apply.

Below the bingo board, it will list all eligible squares for the options selected in the form.
Below the list, you can download a JSON file of all eligible squares. This file is compatable with existing bingo brawlers board generator programs.
